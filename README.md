This repository contains the data used in the paper "**Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base**". The peer-reviewed paper will be presented at The 2024 International Conference on Electric Power and Energy Conversion Systems (EPECS).

## Data
The data consists of global and “First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW)” site a) atmospheric density, b) horizontal wind speed, and c) incident solar flux on a horizontal surface retrieved from the [Mars Climate Database](https://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/mcd_python/) v6.1. All data are provided as txt files. The *Global* folder contains global data from periods with (*GlobalDustStorm*) and without (*NoGlobalDustStorm*) global dust storms, with each hour represented by a separate file. The *FLSWSites* folder contains site data for the 24 sites listed in Table 1 of the paper. Different seasons are represented by: *0VE* for vernal equinox, *90SS* for summer solstice, *180AE* for autumnal equinox, and *270WS* for winter solstice. Additionally, *GS180AE* and *GS270WS* represent global dust storm periods during the autumnal equinox and winter solstice, respectively.
